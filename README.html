        <p>#FreeCodeCamp - Build a Tribute Page
Build a tribute page with HTML and CSS which fulfills to following user stories:</p>
<p>#####User Story #1:
 My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding id=&quot;main&quot;, which contains all other elements.</p>
<p>#####User Story #2: 
I should see an element with a corresponding id=&quot;title&quot;, which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. &quot;Dr. Norman Borlaug&quot;).</p>
<h5 id="user-story-3-">User Story #3:</h5>
<p> I should see a div element with a corresponding id=&quot;img-div&quot;.</p>
<h5 id="user-story-4-">User Story #4:</h5>
<p> Within the img-div element, I should see an img element with a corresponding id=&quot;image&quot;.</p>
<h5 id="user-story-5-">User Story #5:</h5>
<p> Within the img-div element, I should see an element with a corresponding id=&quot;img-caption&quot; that contains textual content describing the image shown in img-div.</p>
<h5 id="user-story-6-">User Story #6:</h5>
<p> I should see an element with a corresponding id=&quot;tribute-info&quot;, which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.</p>
<h5 id="user-story-7-">User Story #7:</h5>
<p> I should see an a element with a corresponding id=&quot;tribute-link&quot;, which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab (i.e. target=&quot;_blank&quot;).</p>
<h5 id="user-story-8-">User Story #8:</h5>
<p> The img element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.</p>
<h5 id="user-story-9-">User Story #9:</h5>
<p> The img element should be centered within its parent element.</p>
